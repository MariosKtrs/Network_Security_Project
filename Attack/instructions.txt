The attack will take place inside the swarm. One of the workers
wants to ddos the master and to do that he is going to compromise
the other workers in the swarm.

Running the script on one of the workers will first update 
the machine and then install hping3

The script will then ask for 3 inputs :

- The user's ip with * in the end for nmap to show the other ips surrounding him
- The victim's ip
- The open port , which will be displayed directly above the prompt

Then we will run the script on the other machines in the swarm, 
and to access them we enter the following command:

ssh docker@<ip>

To identify the attack on the victim's pc, we can enter the following command :

sudo tcpdump 'tcp[tcpflags] == tcp-syn' -n


Enjoy :)
